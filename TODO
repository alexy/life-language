Method Improvement

-- run the same samples on a series of models before them, 
and include the tuples in overall ranking, since we allow
for distinct date in (person,date,perps)

-- try ngrams of different orders

-- try different smoothing methods

-- predict
   for a prefix, generate possible suffixes, and measure the end cloud

-- change
   for two LMs, compare predicted clouds
   or measure KL divergence
