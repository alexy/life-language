You create a ModKneserNey object (Discount.h). Be sure to leave the countsAreModified parameter at the default 
  value (false).

Then invoke ModKneserNey:: estimate() on your counts.  As  a side effect, the lower-order counts will be 
  modified to reflect the context type counts.  Note that the counts of ngrams starting with <s> are unchanged 
  since there are no preceding words for them.
